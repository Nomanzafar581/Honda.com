    <p id="a1"> <em><b>Honda</b></em> was the <mark>first Japanese automobile manufacturer</mark> to release a dedicated luxury
        brand, Acura, on 27 March
        1986. Aside from their core automobile and motorcycle businesses, Honda also manufactures garden equipment,
        marine engines, personal watercraft, power generators, and other products.</p></div>

    <p id="a2">Honda relies on external suppliers for the provision of specific raw materials and motor vehicles parts (“Honda
        Motor,” 2017). The companys ability to obtain the required supplies cost-effectively is subject to a number of
        factors, <em>most of which are behold</em> the Companys control. Consequently, any increase in the price of the raw
        materials results to an increase in the total production cost of Honda Motors. Moreover, the ability of the
        suppliers to provide a steady flow of raw materials plays a significant role in determining the companys
        production. As a result, any loss made by the suppliers increases the overall cost of production in the Honda
        Motor Company.</p>

        <p id="a3">Following the death of Soichiro Honda and the departure of Irimajiri, Honda found itself quickly being outpaced
    in product development by other Japanese automakers and was caught off-guard by the truck and sport utility
    vehicle boom of the 1990s, all which took a toll on the profitability of the company. Japanese media reported in
    1992 and 1993 that Honda was at serious risk of an unwanted and hostile takeover by Mitsubishi Motors, which at
    the time was a larger automaker by volume and was flush with profits from its successful Pajero and Diamante
    models.[23]
    
    Kawamoto acted quickly to change Honda's corporate culture, rushing through market-driven product development
    that resulted in recreational vehicles such as the first-generation Odyssey and the CR-V, and a refocusing away
    from some of the numerous sedans and coupes that were popular with the company's engineers but not with the
    buying public. The most shocking change to Honda came when Kawamoto ended the company's successful participation
    in Formula One after the 1992 season, citing costs in light of the takeover threat from Mitsubishi as well as
    the desire to create a more environmentally friendly company image.[24]</p>
